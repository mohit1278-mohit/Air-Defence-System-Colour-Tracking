# Air Defence System using Colour Tracking 🎯

This project is a **prototype Air Defence System** based on **colour tracking**.  
It uses **Python (OpenCV)** for real-time object detection and **Arduino** for hardware control.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate **computer vision, serial communication, and embedded systems integration**.
